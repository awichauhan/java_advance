/*
types of errors: compile-time, runtime and logical errors

spelling or syntax error: compile time errors (syntactical errors)
output is wrong; complex: logical error (sometimes bugs)
code stops working (execution/app stops): runtime error

runtime error need to be handled in a way that it does not stop the application from running.
that is exception handling
